# Hi, I'm Jonnel Dosado! 👋

Currently working as a technician in an electronics factory, I am passionate about transitioning to a career in software development. As time passed by, I’ve cultivated a deep interest in technology. I am eager to apply my technical background and curiosity to develop web applications that automate tasks and simplify micro-tasks, making processes more efficient. This career shift is driven by my childhood aspiration to work in tech and my commitment to creating impactful solutions.
